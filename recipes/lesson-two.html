        <p>Now that we covered some basic terminology, let's try play a five-finger scale figure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place your RH 1 (right-hand thumb) above the middle C key. Touch the key, but don't press it yet!</li>
            <li>Place your other RH fingers 2345 on the following keys DEFG.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Find the C-position with your left hand also. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The LH 5 (pinky) goes on the C below the right hand.</li>
            <li>The following fingers 4321 goes on the following keys DEFG</li>
            <li>This means that the LH 1 (thumb) is on G.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Due to the symmetry of the hands, when placed paralell on the keys, the fingers of the RH and LH are reversed:</p>
        <p>This means that if we try to play the five-step C major scale, the two hands must use different fingers.</p>
